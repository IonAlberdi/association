##Catchers Service

This is a HelloWorld service that shows the association library developed for the [MediaScape project](http://mediascapeproject.eu/) in action. This service catches the association URL using QR codes, Acoustic codes, Named Web Sockets and Shake&Go tecnologies. For the correct operation of all technologies is recommended to have installed a Named Web Sockets Proxy, a Camera and a Microphone. The example contains calls to the bit.ly shortener service, so before start using the service set your bit.ly user and password in the association.js file that you will find into the "deploy/public/Catchers/js/mediascape/Association/" folder.
