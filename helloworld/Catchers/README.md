##Catchers Service

This is a HelloWorld service that shows the association library developed for the [MediaScape project](http://mediascapeproject.eu/) in action. This service catches the association URL using QR codes, Acoustic codes, Named Web Sockets and Shake&Go tecnologies. For the correct operation of all technologies is recommended to have installed a Named Web Sockets Proxy, a Camera and a Microphone.
